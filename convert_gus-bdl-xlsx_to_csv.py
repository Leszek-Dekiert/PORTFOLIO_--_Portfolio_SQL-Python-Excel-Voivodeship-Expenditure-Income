I. Extraction and conversion from xlsx to CSV_part_1

Preperation of xlsx files in Excel: the source data was cleaned and 
converted so as to leave only the features that really differentiate in the 
column headers: e.g. when selecting the entire scope of specific thematic 
data on the GUS BDL website, the headers remain in the xlsx file as 
row 1: "general", row 2: "general", where in another case 
(selecting more specific data) it would be e.g. row 1: "women", 
row 2: "unemployed". In addition, all the necessary and cleaned data were 
placed in one workbook, divided into sheets.

Code will extract and convert certain data from xlsx file into CSV file.
This data is a GUS BDL type of data extracted from website:
https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/bdl/dane/podgrup/temat.
The type of GUS BDL data that can be converted in this case has been prepared
to have two first columns: code (A) and region (B).
The first row starting from C are years.
User of this code needs to input: data file path, worksheet of the file,
name of new CSV file.
After that process is concluded its recomended to use import feature of Excel
to put all CSV files together for further SQL analisys.
For a different type of data please use the other code stated below.
This code will work with sheets 1, 2, 3, 4 of file: 
"voivodeship_expenditure_income_raw-data-for-conversion"
